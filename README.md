# About
Within the Surf community there's no real standard way to set up various common features that are shared between the Surf gametype between (Source) games. More often than not maps require post-processing to set up things such as starting zones, split zones, actual stages and so on. 

The purpose behind this collection is to add a baseline set of entities that allow mappers to pre-configure their maps to reduce overall overhead for all those involved. While this is designed and intended to be primarily used by the [BB] Surf gamemode the name-spacing has been designed to be generic to encourage mappers to include these in their maps and for other surf communities to hopefully adopt these entities. 

## What's included?
- A ready-to-go fgd that enables mappers to immediately have a full list of all entities that should be available to them.
- A small collection of vmfs that show how these entities can be used.
